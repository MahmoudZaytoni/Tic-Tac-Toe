# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Emu8086

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Emu8086, The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and the goal is to get three of your symbols (either "X" or "O") in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## How to Play

To run the game, you will need to have Emu8086 installed on your computer. Once you have downloaded the repository, open the TicTacToe.asm file in Emu8086 and run the program.

The game is played using the keyboard. Each player takes turns entering the number of the cell where they want to place their symbol. Cells are numbered 1-9, starting from the top-left corner and going from left to right and top to bottom. For example, to place your symbol in the center cell, you would enter "5" (without the quotes) and press Enter.

The game will continue until one player wins or the board is filled with symbols without a winner.
